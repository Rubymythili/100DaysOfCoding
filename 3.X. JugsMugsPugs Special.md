## Write a program that receives a number on the input and prints values from 1 to that number subjected to the conditions below. It also should receive another value 'rev' (either 1 or 0) on the input. 

### For every number in the given range,

#### - If the number is a multiple of 3, or it contains digit 3, it prints "Jugs".   
#### - If the number is a multiple of 5, or it contains digit 5, it prints "Mugs".  
#### - If the number is a multiple of 7, or it contains digit 7, it prints "Pugs".

#### - If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, it prints "JugsMugs".        
####  - also if number contains 3 and 5, it prints "JugsMugs"  
#### - If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 7, it prints "JugsPugs".        
####  - also if number contains 3 and 7, it prints "JugsPugs"
#### - If the number is a multiple of 3, 5 and 7, it prints "JugsMugsPugs".
####       - also if number contains 3, 5 and 7, it prints "JugsMugsPugs"

### Otherwise, it prints the number.

##### REVERSE REQUIREMENT:
###### If the boolean 'rev' is True (or 1), then reverse the order of printing. 
######  - "PugsJugsMugs" for multiples of 3, 5 and 7
######  - "PugsMugs" for multiple of 5 and 7
######  - "MugsJugs" for multiple of 3 and 5 
######  - "PugsJugs" for multiple of 3 and 7

#Check Condition and print:
