## Write a program that receives a number on the input.
### It also should receive another value 'rev' (either 1 or 0) on the input. 

####  - If the number is a multiple of 3, or it contains digit 3, it prints "Jugs". 
####  - If the number is a multiple of 5, or it contains digit 5, it prints "Mugs".
####  - If the number is a multiple of 7, or it contains digit 7, it prints "Pugs".

####  - If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, it prints "JugsMugs".
####        - also if number contains 3 and 5, it prints "JugsMugs"
####  - If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 7, it prints "JugsPugs".
####        - also if number contains 3 and 7, it prints "JugsPugs"
####  - If the number is a multiple of 3, 5 and 7, it prints "JugsMugPugs".
####        - also if number contains 3, 5 and 7, it prints "JugsMugsPugs"

### Otherwise, it prints the number.

#### REVERSE REQUIREMENT:
##### If the boolean 'rev' is True (or 1), then reverse the order of printing. 
 ##### - "PugsJugsMugs" for multiples of 3, 5 and 7
#####  - "PugsMugs" for multiple of 5 and 7
#####  - "MugsJugs" for multiple of 3 and 5 
#####  - "PugsJugs" for multiple of 3 and 7
