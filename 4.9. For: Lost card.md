## There was a set of cards with numbers from 1 to N. One of the card is now lost. Determine the number on that lost card given the numbers for the remaining cards.

## Given a number N, followed by N âˆ’ 1 integers representing the numbers on the remaining cards (distinct integers in the range from 1 to N). Find and print the number on the lost card.

```
#Read integer:
N=int(input())

#intialize variable:
lost_card = N
temp =0

#sum the set of given cards:
for i in range(N-1):
    N=int(input())
    temp += N
    
#sum the actual card :
for j in range(lost_card):
    lost_card += j
    j += 1

#Difference between given and actual:
lost_card -= temp

#print the lost card:
print(lost_card)
